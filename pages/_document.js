            <h5>Is there any Copyright risk on YouTube Thumbnails?</h5>
            Whatever YouTube screenshot you are downloading is a copyright of the respective owner of that video. If you want to use it in your work, then you should ask for permission.
            Especially if you are reusing it on YouTube, then it can create problems. But if your plan is outside of YouTube, like using it on a website for creating logos or any Photoshop types of stuff, then there is no problem. You'll hardly receive any DMCA complaints related to that particular YouTube thumbnail.
          </p>

          <p>
            <h5>Is reusing YouTube thumbnails SEO friendly?</h5>
            Nope, it's not SEO friendly because almost all thumbnails on YouTube are indexed by Google. So which one is unique and which one is duplicate, Google knows it. So it's not SEO friendly as you know. But you can do some stuff on that thumbnail, I mean getting some unique effects using Photoshop or any other software that can make your thumbnail unique again so that it can be reused and make it SEO friendly again.
